# SimpleFoodRebalance

A simple Minecraft mod to add a little bit of difficulty, by hitting players where they least expect it: *food*

## What Does It Do?

First and most obvious, is this mod limits food to a single item per stack, just like pre 1.8 Beta
That, is because all food now has NBT data associated with it, which holds information about how long
each item has existed; because food now spoils if left unrefrigerated.

The good news is, food also gives certain bonuses depending on what type of food it is, and if it's properly cooked.
This can include health regen, or movement speed (Or even negative effects, if raw food is eaten).

Ontop of food spoiling, it's also harder to craft, being a more indepth process. 

No more relying on bread forever!
